//Based on vehicle type and different distance ranges  -> a price is calculated

//Based on v demand or harsh weather -> half amount from previous calculate amount  is added
//Except pool according to vehicle type if expected time < actual time -> additional amount is added


////distance in meters ,expectedtime,actualtime,tolls,demand,harshweather,waitingtime,vehicletype -> INPUT 
let travel1 = new Uber(34000,20,60,2,true,false,3,"suv")
travel1.calculateFare();

let travel2 = new Uber(5000,15,12,2,false,false,15,"auto");
travel2.calculateFare();



OUTPUT:


Based on distance the base price is 360
Based on tolls during the ride , the  price is 400
Based on demand/bad weather during the ride , the  price is 600



Based on distance the base price is 20
Based on waiting time / greater ride time than expected  , the  price is 40
